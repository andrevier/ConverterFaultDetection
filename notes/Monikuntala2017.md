Good review in the intro.
The paper is about a method of open and short-circuit fault detection in semicondutor switches in an diode clamped multilevel inverter.

The stator current signals are decomposed in discrete wavelet coefficients of level 12 with mother wavelet Daubechies, 4 vanishing moments. The approximation coefficients are further processed into energy features.

Then, these features are feed into a probabilistic neural network (NN), which uses probability density function as activation. The NN has 4 layers: Input, hidden, pattern and output.
