The present study has also adopted signal-based approach to locate and classify different spurious resistance faults in IM drive system. 

To investigate IM drive fault, various signal acquisition types can be broadly divided into three cate-gories: voltage signals at specific points of the system, machine current signature (MCS), and mechanical vibration signal (VS) along different axes of the motor.

The acquired inverter output three-phase current is represented into two vectors and normalized. Time-domain features are then obtained from these normalized vectors. This has given a newfinding about a particular pattern in which a normalized feature called mean current vector (MCV) gets arranged with respect to different types of spurious resistance faults. Then, regions of similar behavior in the plane are distinguished with SVM.

The authors applied a series resistance with the IGBT to simulate degradation stages of the switch. The maximum value was 50 Ohms. The paper doesn't cite every resistance value used but say that the chosen values came from a previous work and they are chosen in order that the current maximum is approximate with the nominal value. The addition of a series resistance with the IGBT move the currents downward, in the selected phase, or upward, in the other phases.

If the nominal is 8.15 A RMS, then, 11.5 A peake.

Load and current are related.
