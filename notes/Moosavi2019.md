This article studies the open-circuit fault of IGBT in an
electric vehicle in dynamic conditions. The system envolves an inverter of a PMSM with vector control.

Features extraction is done in the three-phase currents by wavelet decomposition and 4 algorithm for fault detection are tested: NN, SVM, SOM, and K-Means.

Single and double faults in IGBTs were considered and the system is tested with different loads.

Few details about each algorithm makes the article irreproductible.
